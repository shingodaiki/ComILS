Note: All XAML icons from VS 2017 Icon Pack are modified to not include a `Viewbox` XAML root element. We always use a `Drawing`-derived root element.
Note: When changing an icon, start with SVG and use https://github.com/BerndK/SvgToXaml to generate the XAML. The result is much better XAML than what Inkscape produces.
